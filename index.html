                    Hello, my name is Subha and I am a huge Computer Science and Software enthusiast! I started to program in 2018 after I was told 
                    by my peers I could not learn how to code because I was not “smart enough”. However, I proved that doubt to be incorrect, and 
                    instead the doubts fueled my passion and drive. I continued to study different programming knowledge, technological advancements, 
                    and research! I have loved technology for the longest time, and I truly believe it is my calling.

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    In addition to my love for Computer Science, I have various skills that help me succeed in this area. I see myself as someone 
                    who loves solving problems and never shies away from challenges. Being adaptable and always eager to learn is how I approach 
                    life and my studies. I really value working with others. I thrive in teams where different ideas come together to find new 
                    solutions. Besides my tech interests, I'm passionate about books and reading. They give me an escape and expose me to diverse 
                    ideas, which I think helps me solve problems better and understand different subjects more broadly.

                <p class="fade-right">
                    My Python journey started a while ago, but I have only begun organizing and documenting my projects when taking Grade 11 Computer Science.
                </p>
                <h3 class="fade-right"><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Sz74UEHvpbdh_bliEwU4G6ODf-JQkdlk?usp=sharing" target="_blank">First Print Statements and Basic Operations</a></h3>
            
                <p class="fade-right">
                    In Grade 11 Computer Science, we started with the basics of Python. We reviewed how to print statements and make basic operations. Though this was something
                    I was familar with, it was still fun to create small projects with this knowledge. Programs that were the most fun to create using basic print statements and 
                    operations were ones that created art. Who knew that you could create houses, shapes, and even faces using just characters and operations!?
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3 class="fade-right"><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1z94rnppspVK09YejGsqpN--QwlH96Un5?usp=drive_link" target="_blank">Variables, Inputs, and Outputs</a></h3>
            
                <p class="fade-right">
                    The journey continues with variables, and taking basic inputs and outputs from users. Now I was able to interact with the users and create small, fun games
                    using the knowledge of inputs and operations. Since I enjoyed the art I created in the previous unit, a fun game that I created was asking the user to input 
                    the shape and size they wanted, and printed it. I made similar projects to these, experimenting with the different applications I can make, like finance
                    and other calculators.  
                </p>

                <p class="fade-right">
                    Let the journey go on! We then moved onto if/else statements. Now I was able to add multitasking to the projects I created. I was able to create
                    applications that asked the user questions, and acted depending on their answers. When learning Python on my own, I was familar how to do this, but
                    with the knowledge in class, I was able to learn how to implement if/else statements in smart ways, especially through efficient nesting if/else statement
                    strategies.
                </p>

                <p class="fade-right">
                    Loops, loops, and more loops! Loops are definitely one of my favourite aspects in Python, since they are extermely useful and quick to use! We started
                    to learn about while and for loops, which can be implemented in many of the existing programs to replace repeating if/else statements. It's almost like magic!
                    I learned how to solve problems with both types of loops, which definitely expanded my knowledge on when to use which loops. 
                </p>

                <br>

                <h3 class="fade-right"><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1N5rcOx13_q9c8Y7I1_ygBJ0s_Q1aQLrQ?usp=drive_link" target="_blank">Strings</a></h3>
                <p class="fade-right">
                    This was definitely one of the shorter units in Grade 11 Computer Science, since of course we could not spend time going through every single String Method
                    to exist, unless we wanted the class to fall asleep. Instead, in this unit we reviewed the most commonly used string methods, such as format and index. In my own
                    time, I spent time going through different string methods that could be useful for my existing applications.
                </p>

                <p class="fade-right">
                    It's time for lists! Another short unit in the Grade 11 Computer Science course, but of course, still a very fun one! Who knew that something as simple
                    as lists containing multiple items could be so helpful? I used lists in many of my applications as a method of storing information from the user (before
                    I knew what databases where, of course). Depending on the application, I used lists differently, whether I was splitting it, manipulating the data within, 
                    or accessing it.
                </p>

                <p class="fade-right">
                    The final unit of Grade 11 Computer science, at last! Of course, the unit of functions was the longest unit of all, since now we needed to implement every unit
                    from the course into functions. I knew how to make simple functions, but with the knowledge learned in class, I was able to create more complex functions that
                    were efficient, used less code, and worked for a variety of applications. I even learned how to create functions nested within each other with my knowledge
                    of nested if/else statements!
                </p>
                 
                <br>

                <p class="fade-right">
                    Time to battle the big beast! The final summative that was given at the end of the Grade 11 Computer Science course was definitely a journey, a very long two-week,
                    staring at my computer screen for hours, journey. We were tasked with creating an alpha to decimal, and vise versa, calculator that followed a very detailed, specific
                    set of rules. Though it took me all that time, I learned so much! I was able to mix together all my skills from the previous units to complete a working application!
                    All the hours sitting on my desk working at this long problem paid off, and definitely granted me a great load of self satisfaction!

                <p class="fade-right">
                    Moving on to what I learned in Grade 12 Computer Science! This course taught me about a lot of concepts in Python I was unaware of, and would not have discovered 
                    and experimented with without this course. Not only did I extend and strengthen the knowledge and skills I learned in Grade 11 and also on my own, but I also got 
                    to learn new skills and create fun projects that allowed me to express my creativity.
                </p>
                <h3 class="fade-right"><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VJlq8Mve8tN8Viwz7VPDxADmylin3Yxk?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Extension on Lists</a></h3>
            
                <p class="fade-right">
                    Though the beginning of the Grade 12 Computer Science course was mainly review from Grade 11, such as review on functions, string methods, loops, etc., I 
                    will not be discussing these concepts on this page as it can all be found on the Grade 11 page. However, a topic that we expanded on that really interested me 
                    was the versatility of lists. In this course, we covered multidimensional lists, and how this simple concept can be used for so many programs (eg. creating board 
                    games, tables, etc.). I got the chance to create fun games, such as a battleship equivalent game.
                </p>

                <h3 class="fade-right"><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1x5wtPgAO6093raPf7PGBp27Ji1SrYpjO?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Dictionaries</a></h3>
            
                <p class="fade-right">
                    After learning about lists, the course covered dictionaries! I was aware of dictionaries beforehand, I did not use them as often, but now I got the chance to 
                    extend my knowledge on how to use dictionaries. Creating the dictionaries creates easier ways to access data, retrieve, and delete information. Instead of having to 
                    go through multiple lists and rely on indexes, I can take advantage of the speed and efficiency of dictionaries. I was able to create a lot of fun projects, like 
                    an item stocking program, and a simple login interface.

                <p class="fade-right">
                    Another quick topic covered in the course that I felt the need to mention, as it has changed the way I program nowadays, is using exception handling! To keep 
                    things sweet and simple, I learned about the easier way to catch errors using try/except, and the multiple errors you can catch to further give users instructions. 
                    I use this method of catching mistakes through my programs now, but some examples of how I used try/except could be seen in the examples above.

                <p class="fade-right">
                    Who knows the concept of calling functions within functions could save so much time! Recursions were definitely one of the topics that took me the most time 
                    to understand, but once I did, it was mind blowing! By using diagrams and drawing out how the functions within each other worked, I was able to complete complex 
                    operations using as little code as possible. Examples you can see of how I used recursions include computing a factorial sequence, the fibonacci sequence, and other 
                    mathematical operations.

                <p class="fade-right">
                    This was a unit in the course we covered the most, as reading/writing text files was used when creating apps to hold and retrieve user data. Though there were 
                    not a lot of functions when reading and writing text files, since you could store the data in whatever way you would like to, text files could be used for so many 
                    different programs! Some fun programs I created including a login interface, grades application, sports score calculator, etc. I even used text files in future units 
                    in the course, which can be viewed through programs linked for the units below.

                <p class="fade-right">
                    Similar to the structure of text files, we also covered binary files. Though binary files are more secure and used for actual applications to hide information, 
                    for simplicity, we used text files more rather than binary files. However, the knowledge of using binary files, and the pickle module used, is something I used when 
                    creating my own applications. I created an Employee Record Management system to secure and hide the data of employees, and in the future I plan on creating similar 
                    applications or modifying my existing applications using text files to use secure binary files instead.

                <p class="fade-right">
                    I found the topic of CSV files to be very similar to text files, and the importing, writing, appending, etc., strategies were very similar. The use of Comma Separated 
                    Values made it very easy to fetch data and translate it to use and manipulate, which I found made my programs quicker. That being said, to practice my hand at using CSV 
                    files to store data, I replicated my programs using text files but with CSV files. I created another sports score calculator but using CSV files, and also made a 
                    temperature application to store daily temperatures.

                <p class="fade-right">
                    This unit made my programs so much easier to work with! The ability to instead of having multiple files but now adding them all into one file and linking them together, 
                    is so helpful! There is great accessibility with SQLITE databases, and instead of having to work through multiple files of data to make manipulations or additions, now I 
                    could just access the tables within the database and make my changes. I made some smaller SQLITE databases, like a student tracker to link marks and students, and an 
                    organization tracker to link employees and their information, and there are still some applications I am currenting working on. Though I know how to use SQLITE databases, 
                    the knowledge is endless, and there are still features I am researching to further improve my programs.

                <p class="fade-right">
                    There was so much to learn within this unit, and still is a lot to discover! Object-Oriented Program really improved my structure and brushed-up on my programming style. 
                    I think after learning about OOP, I have become faster, efficient, and productive when programming. I am able to troubleshoot my mistakes faster, reuse my code through the 
                    concept of inheritance, and better structure my data using classes. Within the course, we learned about magic methods to make my life easier when programming, and even how 
                    to manipulate them to do what we want. Due to the global access, code organization, and overall independence, I was able to create programs without having to repeat writing, 
                    such as area calculators, vector calculator, system of equations calculator, and so many other applications that I would write with regular functions, but now could be written 
                    with OOP. I still use the structure of OOP because I enjoy the organization and efficiency, and thus this unit within the course has definitely impacted my skills as a programmer.

                <p class="fade-right">
                    Moving on, using the Python Tkinter module was extremely fun for me! I was now able to use my creative and artistic skills when I created websites and use it to create appealing 
                    yet functional applications. These applications combined my skills with everything I have used within this course, in Grade 11, and everything I have done on my own. Using the 
                    functions such as Labels, Buttons, Toplevel, Frames, etc., I created a lot of fun apps, having fun with the boundless opportunities available. I created a Text Analyzer, Login/Setup 
                    Page, Library Management System, Length Convertor, and I am currently working on a fully functional Markbook for teachers to manage their students and courses as a summative project 
                    for the course. Usually I am used to creating fun games or webpages to practice my programming skills, but creating these applications allows me to make applications that help solve
                    tasks and make life easier for others. I plan on continuing to use Python Tkinter and making more applications, and possibly publishing some in the future!

                        Welcome to the HTML/CSS page of my programming journey website! HTML and CSS were my 
                        first two programming languages I learned, and the two that also fuelled my love for programming. 
                        I loved the creativity and boundless programs you can make with these simple languages, and how you 
                        can make them function and look however you would like to! In this page, I will be discussing my learning 
                        journey with the languages, not every single topic, but the major projects I created to gain certificates 
                        from online platforms such as freeCodeCamp.

                    I completed the full Responsive Web Design course in 2021, completing roughly 300 hours of course work and learning a ton of new concepts 
                    while also expanding on some I was already familiar with. I started with brushing up on my skills on creating the foundation of a website 
                    using HTML, adding text, links, and images, and then expanding with adding CSS to make the web pages more appealing. Then, I learned how 
                    to add functionality to the web pages and make forms where the user could now interact with my webpages. Finally, I learned about flexbox 
                    and how to make my page accessible to different screen sizes, keeping the display and format accessible for all users. There were more 
                    smaller topics I learned in this course as well that I continued to explore on my own, such as CSS grids and animations, and other 
                    skills I still use when creating web pages (like this one!).

                        One project that I was required to complete to gain this certification was creating a survey form. I was able to combine my HTML and CSS skills to 
                        create a form that was interactive for users and also appealing. I had a lot of fun creating this survey form, as though it may look simple, it 
                        took me time to think of an appealing design with colors that went together, while all components also functioned together. The HTML portion of 
                        this survey form was not very difficult, as it only required me to add text and labels, but the CSS portion was more involved. I had to carefully 
                        select colors, fonts, and styles that not only looked good but also worked well together, enhancing the overall user experience. It really tested 
                        my artistic skills but definitely taught me how to make my web pages more appealing! In the end I am very proud of my survey form creation as it 
                        built up my foundation on how to create interactive forms and now I can expand on them, creating ones that combine with Javascript or Python to 
                        add to an application!

                    When I was working on my certification project, creating a tribute webpage was a big part of it. HTML, the main language for making web pages, was a key focus. 
                    It was like building blocks, using HTML to create the structure of the page. I discovered that using HTML for pictures was pretty interesting. I could do more 
                    than just put them on the page. I could make them bigger or smaller and decide where they should go. It was like arranging things in a room to make it look nice. 
                    Another cool thing I found out was how to make a bunch of pictures look organized. I learned how to place them in a line or make a grid. This made the webpage 
                    look fancier, especially for the tribute I was making. But it wasn't just about looks. I realized that using HTML for pictures also meant I could describe them. 
                    This was helpful for people who might not be able to see the pictures. Adding these descriptions made the webpage more understandable for everyone. So, playing 
                    around with images in HTML wasn't just about making things look good. It was also about making the web page easy for everyone to use and enjoy.

                        When I was working on a project to create a webpage about writing a good essay, I learned a lot about using HTML for technical documentation. HTML was the main tool 
                        I used to structure the webpage and make it easy to navigate. One thing that stood out was making a side menu bar. With HTML, I figured out how to create a menu that 
                        stayed on the side of the webpage. This menu had links to different parts of the essay writing guide, like 'Introduction,' 'Body,' 'Conclusion,' and Parts of Essays.' 
                        It was like having a map that helps you jump to different sections without scrolling through the whole page. I found out how to use HTML to create these links. By 
                        using specific HTML tags and attributes, I made the menu items clickable, so when someone clicked on 'Body,' for example, it would take them straight to the section 
                        about writing the main part of the essay. This made the webpage user-friendly. Readers could easily jump to the section they wanted to read without having to scroll
                        up and down. It was a hands-on way to understand how HTML helps create a well-organized and easy-to-use webpage for technical guides.

                        This section of my website is dedicated to JavaScript, the language that helped during my programming journey. I wanted to learn 
                        this language because of its potential on web pages, allowing me to bring ideas to life in exciting ways. The fantastic about JavaScript is 
                        the freedom it offers to customize everything to your liking! I didn't enroll in a formal JavaScript course. Instead, I taught 
                        myself by reading and researching through the internet. My learning journey involved exploring a variety of different projects 
                        from <a href="https://code-projects.org/c/languages/project/jsprojects/" target="_blank">websites</a>. On this page, I'll share the highlights of my JavaScript

                    just about making things look good, JavaScript adds life into the website, enabling interactions that engage users on a whole new level. I've been constantly learning and 
                    advancing my skills to elevate my portfolio website further. I also implemented my HTML and CSS skills to combine with the JavaScript functionality! These skills have been

                        Studying JavaScript Projects in code-projects.org has been a huge help in my learning process. Whenever I explore a code there, I take my time to understand how it works.
                         I jot down notes and really dig into how different functions and features are made. It's like figuring out a puzzle! By doing this, I've learned a lot about how to make 
                         things work better on my own webpages. This project has given me awesome ideas and strategies that I've used to add cool stuff like interactive elements to my sites.

                    One project on the same website that stood out was this patient data system, a real complex maze of files and data, there were so many different files! What made it fascinating 
                    was my prior knowledge of databases and SQL from high school could be implemented and used here. This project took that knowledge to the next level by demonstrating how to connect 
                    all these different files to create something truly valuable. Managing all these files and using SQL to handle patient info taught me more about building practical applications. 
                    It's like taking what I learned in class and seeing it come alive in a real-world project. This experience has given me a deeper understanding of how these tools can be used to 
                    craft functional and useful applications.
